      <h1 class="text">Discussion Questions:</h1>
      <p class="text">
      1. Isn't Rich User Experience a paradox / a big lie, since when users are supposed to be "experiencing" they are in fact passively, unilaterally receiving a story staged by the designers (in other words, experiencing the experience created by the designers only)?
      <br>
      <br>
      2. How can us designers figure out a way to create abstractions that eases operations for a specific purpose but would not distort everything else?
      <br>
      <br>
      3. For those who have no access to the internet, especially for those with their culture not represented in mainstream media, how can we make the web design community feel like home to them and despite being culturally-inclusive, what about those visually-challenged or disabled? How can we make cyber-art more accessible?
      <br>
      <br>
      4. Though archiving rallies/revolution can be incredibly effective prompting everyone who has access to any forms of media to participate, how can we keep the history alive in places without media coverage?
      <br>
      <br>
      5. How can we resolve the dilemma that "those with resources to data collection lack incentives and vise versa"? How do we ensure that those with means and will to collect data is offered opportunities to act?
      <br>
      <br>
      6. Similar to how Morehshin Allahyari confronted irrationality within censorship with seemingly irrational arts, how shall we artists and designers come up with entirely new ideas to resolve the serious with lighthearted/amusing artistic approach, while advocating for justice?
      <br>
      <br>
      7. Isn't it sarcastic, according to Yaa Addae, that we constantly complain about how predatory tech can be while we're still working within it and enjoying the convenience that follows? Are more people techno-optimist or techno-pessimist?
      <br>
      <br>
      8. In his interview, Hamid Khan mentions that "any time surveillance gets legitimized, then it is open to be expanded over time", then how can we live under a society that's pro-surveillance and considers it as a proxy for marginalization? To speak against injustice emerged from prejudiced surveillance, can we confront it with technology also?
