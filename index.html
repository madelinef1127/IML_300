      <h1>Discussion Questions:</h1>
      1. Isn't Rich User Experience a paradox / a big lie, since when users are supposed to be "experiencing" they are in fact passively, unilaterally receiving a story staged by the designers (in other words, experiencing the experience created by the designers only)?
      <br>
      2. How can us designers figure out a way to create abstractions that eases operations for a specific purpose but would not distort everything else?
      <br>
      3. For those who have no access to the internet, especially for those with their culture not represented in mainstream media, how can we make the web design community feel like home to them and despite being culturally-inclusive, what about those visually-challenged or disabled? How can we make cyber-art more accessible?
      <br>
      4. Though archiving rallies/revolution can be incredibly effective prompting everyone who has access to any forms of media to participate, how can we keep the history alive in places without media coverage?
      <br>
      5. How can we resolve the dilemma that "those with resources to data collection lack incentives and vise versa"? How do we ensure that those with means and will to collect data is offered opportunities to act?
